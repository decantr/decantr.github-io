                The human experience was once thought unique in its use of tools to complete tasks that were once impossible or to improve the efficiency of the output. The rate of technological advancement has seen an exponential explosion since the industrial revolution
                and the pace shows no signs of slowing down. Consider in the 1903 the first successful airplane flight, a decade later these were dropping bombs in the first world war, 30 years after that we had flights across the atlantic, 30 more and
                we see man in space. With hindsight It’s easy to take these spectacular developments have sometimes catastrophic impacts in industries and workplaces, you need merely to think of the Glasgow shipyards after the invention of the combustion
                engine, but can we glimpse at these consequences of emerging technologies such as those from the Robotics field.
                <br /><br /> The robotics industry has been steadily growing since the mid 20th century, though until the 70’s they were something you might only see on Star Trek, the 80’s ‘the robot boom’ saw a huge amount of investment and development
                in the sector. Today we think of robots no longer in terms of arms on an assembly line where the industry began, but as humanoid automatons that wouldn’t be out of place behind a store counter or performing daily tasks around your house.
                As we see the fields of robotics march forward hand-in-hand with Artificial Intelligence into more facets of our both private and work lives in a myriad of areas such as Construction, Entertainment, Healthcare, Agriculture do we need to
                question the social and ethical impacts caused by this.

        <p>
            There are significant moral and ethical factors inherent in the issue of automation. Some areas with the potential for augmentation in this manner present the question of whether or not using robotics can be morally justified.<br/><br />
            <h5>Medicine</h5> “Clinical Decision Support Systems” are a kind of AI Expert System used in the field of medicine. Their intended use is to support clinical personnel by providing recommendations for treatment based upon information about the patient's condition
            given to the system by a doctor. These may cover gaps in the doctor's own medical knowledge, but can a machine understand a patient's subjective “feelings”? What might be considered extreme pain for one patient could be mild discomfort to
            another, and only an experienced doctor could diagnose the common condition behind two different sensations. It must be said that in practice these expert systems have shown to be an overall positive, helping doctors to make correct treatment
            decisions. Unfeeling of fatigue and incapable of But the importance of having a human doctor to make the final decision seems clear. At the moment there seems little potential for these systems to become anything more than knowledge bases
            to augment the doctor's own medical experience.<br /><br />
            <h5>War</h5> Artificial Intelligence has often been associated with war. One need only consider movies like The Terminator (1984) to understand how the risks of AI have been understood in the public consciousness almost since its inception. But at the
            same time replacing human soldiers with robots on the battlefield might seem a noble goal. Could future warfare be conducted by remote control? To some degree it already is. Militaries around the world regularly deploy Unmanned Air Vehicles,
            drones, to commit violence from half a world away. At this time there is presumably always a human at the controls, but for how much longer? Even were soldiers to be replaced en masse by expendable robots, and wars decided by the manufacturing
            prowess of the belligerents, people will always be present at ground zero. Who is responsible if a robot guns down an innocent person? A trivia note: the UK Ministry of Defence currently operates a network of satellites providing communications
            to the British Armed Forces. The engineer who gave it the name Skynet perhaps saw some irony in the choice.<br /><br />

            Some jobs are more at risk than others. Artificial Intelligence cannot make the decisions the major CEO needs to make to grow his company. Or can it? Would a statistic-led approach be able to substitute an executive's instincts? The more detailed the field of data analytics gets the better able an AI system will be to make decisions, purely by interpretation and analysis of previous decisions and market conditions.
            And so we see that no job is truly safe. If it can be boiled down to 1s and 0s, Yes or No. And the more brainpower we devote to the pursuit of reducing every analogue situation into digital inputs and outputs the sooner this eventuality occurs. What will it mean for our society when mass unemployment pushes out the majority?
            <br /><br />
            Automation, though it might seem new and scary to many, is not a novel concept.
            As we've seen, humans harnessing technology to make tasks easier has occurred throughout our history. But jamming a rock in a stick to make a spear is hardly comparable to the mass replacement of human workers in factories after the introduction
            of the more efficient assembly line during the Industrial Revolution. What happened then?<br /><br /> It appears that competition for the remaining jobs resulted in severe rates of unemployment, at least for the early stages of the period.
            The machines rendered many skilled trades entirely obsolete. Working and living conditions were poor, and life was miserable, tragic and short. The worsening conditions of life gave rise to civil unrest, the Luddite attacks and backlash from
            rising labour movements. That these events might be repeated were a similar Robotics Revolution occur again doesn't seem so far-fetched.
            <br /><br />
            But that was then. Don't we nowadays have a more enlightened society, more humanitarian labour
            laws, protections and safety nets?
            <br /><br />
            Perhaps, but likely not enough. The welfare system we have now is not designed to deal with a rapid influx of unemployed workers, skilled or not. When it's cheaper for one company to replace the
            majority of its workforce with machinery, others will follow suit quickly. Unemployment, austerity and poverty bring with them more crime, worse mental health and more strain on medical and law enforcement services. Is our society sitting
            on a powder keg with a fuse potentially only a decade long?
            <br /><br />
            If the current systems are incapable, we may have to reinvent them. We have decades of thought and research to draw from. Ideas such as an unconditional Basic Income,
            in which every adult citizen is paid an annual sum regardless of employment, may be where we look. Restructures of existing systems, looking at work in a different way.
            <br /><br />
            There are solutions to the problems of a future automated
            scarcity society, and we may have to trust in our government to make the correct choice in the moment, and in timely fashion too. Whether we achieve a post-scarcity utopia or lose our progress and echo some of the misery of the Industrial
            Revolution remains to be seen.

                It is difficult to come to any definitive conclusions with regard to these issues. While historical precedent has taught us that automation can have dire consequences for the populace, subsequent societal changes have improved our standard of living monumentally.
                It is easy to guess that a rapid adoption of automation across industries would be more likely to result in civil upheaval than a gradual change, but we cannot presume to know how easy either transition would be. We must only keep faith
                that society will readily adapt to changing times as we have in the past.
